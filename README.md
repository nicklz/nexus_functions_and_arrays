# Functions and Arrays

"Functions and Arrays" is a file management, data management, and prompt engineering framework designed as an anti-framework. It's streamlined to just three essential files, capable of building extensive codebases across various languages and frameworks.

## Introduction

This framework harnesses the power of [Q], a proprietary AI service available through [Cyberdyne Robotic Systems](https://cyberdynerobotic.systems/). It eliminates the need to worry about syntax in different languages, focusing instead on the logical setup of two crucial files: arrays and functions.

## Files Overview

### `function_process.php`

This script orchestrates the core functionalities of the "Functions and Arrays" framework. It manages data processing, file operations, and executes commands efficiently. Below is an overview of the key functions:

- **`nexus_snake_case($string)`**: Converts a string to snake_case format.
- **`nexus_replace_tokens($string)`**: Replaces tokens in a string with their corresponding characters.
- **`nexus_get_filename($command)`**: Extracts the filename from a command string.
- **`nexus_process_bits($bits, $variables, $type, $command_input, $command_number, &$weight)`**: Processes bits of data and updates variables based on their type and key.
- **`nexus_process_array($input_array)`**: Processes an input array, sorting and executing commands or updating files.
- **`nexus_process_file($file_path, $variables = ['COMMANDS' => []])`**: Processes a file and updates variables based on its content.
- **`nexus_q($input)`**: Executes a command and handles prompts using [Q], translating output based on file extensions.

### `array_data`

This file serves as the data repository for "Functions and Arrays", storing configurations, arguments, and metadata crucial for executing commands and managing files within the framework.

### Example Usage

#### Setting Up Example1

To demonstrate the functionality of the framework, let's consider setting up an example project named "example1":

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to access example projects.

2. **Generate Code**: Code in `examples/example1` is generated from the array and function files. If [Q] is installed, file systems can be generated similarly.
